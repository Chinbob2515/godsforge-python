Any server client interaction should be initiated by client, and receive a (single) response from the server (RESTFUL, I think).
Maybe in later developement, listeners can be registered- but this is very far off. For now, constant polling should be used to simulate "real time" updates.

For now, each server instance can only host one game- demand does not require more.

TODO
- Any github things.
- Add a more secure authentication system.
